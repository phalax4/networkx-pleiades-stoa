# Challenges
* Issue with minified react and force graph 3d and vr libraries
switched to just the 2d library, and used the gatsby workaround with loadable and config
* Issue with aframe - on another machine, use only 2d library
* performance of visualization
react-sigma crashed
d3 required too much tweaking, slow
react force 2d - start with zoom out then zoom in, adjust cooldown ticker, disable node drag
* foudn it hard to get sigmajs or vis.js vanilla to work with react, or read in gephx file.
* in terms of jupyter notebook
 number or nodes, number of links, communities, strong and weak connected components, page rank, change to directed??
 some nodes missing titles

some challenges in using what connections, dont add extra connections as nodes in. instead of id use uri.
